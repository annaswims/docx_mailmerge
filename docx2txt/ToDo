1. Handle lists in better way. [partly worked on, target latest by v2.0]

2. Heuristics based cleanup of damaged document content. [Looking for more test samples.]

3. Extract images. Now there has been a user request as well. [target pre v2.0]
4. Handle footnotes.
5. Improve table and short line justification handling. Ideally table columns
   in a single row should be separated by pipe. Short line justification needs
   to be adjusted to situations when tab occurs in line. A quick look into these
   issues suggests that logic/code will need to be reorganised to handle these.

6. Create a simple manpage, hopefully after resolving footnote and list issues.
7. Implement simple state-machine for speedup [partially worked towards it].
8. XML parsing??? and making things more efficient. When it has matured enough,
   may be a C/C++ version should be looked into.
