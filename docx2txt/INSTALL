Non-Windows users, please adjust following executables paths before proceeding
for installation.

- #! path for env in docx2txt.sh and docx2txt.pl
- path for unzip in docx2txt.config

You can skip installing docx2txt.sh and docx2txt.bat wrapper scripts (as
applicable) during manual installation. These check for overwriting the output
text file and have slightly restricted usage as compared to core docx2txt.pl
script. [check README for details]

However if you are using CakeCmd unzipper, docx2txt.bat can be quite handy as
it internally manages unzipping the .docx files that do not have .zip extension.



Installation on Linux, Cygwin, BSD and similar systems
------------------------------------------------------

Type "make" as root to install docx2txt script files for all users in
/usr/local/bin and system-wide configuration file in /etc .

If you want to install these in some other directory, you can do so via

make BINDIR=/path/to/scripts/directory CONFIGDIR=/path/to/config/directory

BSD users can use either GNU make or BSD make.

Linux "make" installation also attempts to set systemConfigDir variable in
installed docx2txt.pl file to specified CONFIGDIR.

You will need make and install utilities installed on your system for
installation via Makefile.

In case, you don't want to use Makefile for installation, you can follow these
steps for manual installation.

1. Copy docx2txt.pl, docx2txt.sh and docx2txt.config to the desired directories.

   cp docx2txt.pl docx2txt.sh /path/to/scripts/directory
   cp docx2txt.config /path/to/config/directory

2. Change the permission of copied files to 755 for docx2txt.pl and docx2txt.sh,
   and 644 for docx2txt.config .

   chmod 755 /path/to/scripts/directory/docx2txt.*
   chmod 644 /path/to/config/directory/docx2txt.config

3. Change the value of systemConfigDir variable (in non-Windows settings) in
   installed docx2txt.pl file from "/etc" to specified config directory.

4. Add the concerned scripts directory to your PATH, if not already in PATH.

   PATH=$PATH:/path/to/scripts/directory


Installation on Windows
-----------------------

I. You can install minimal Cygwin packages from http://www.cygwin.com/ to have
   working bash, cat, env, install, make, perl and unzip utilities and thus
   create the required Cygwin environment for using this utility.

II. If you do not want to install even minimal Cygwin, you can try following
   sequence for manual installation.

a. Get following files from /usr/bin/ of cygwin installation and place them in,
   say C:\docx2txt .

   cygwin1.dll
   perl.exe
   cygperl*.dll
   unzip.exe
   cygcrypt*.dll

b. Copy docx2txt.pl, docx2txt.bat and docx2txt.config to C:\docx2txt .

c. Change path for unzip in docx2txt.config to C:/docx2txt/unzip.exe and path
   for perl in docx2txt.bat to C:\docx2txt\perl.exe .

d. You can now use this tool from within C:\docx2txt as follows.

   docx2txt.bat file.docx
   docx2txt.bat path-to-directory\file.docx

   perl docx2txt.pl file.docx
   perl docx2txt.pl directory\file.docx -
   perl docx2txt.pl directory/file.docx file.txt
   perl docx2txt.pl C:/somedir/file.docx
   perl docx2txt.pl C:\somedir\file.docx C:\otherdir\converted.txt

   Please view README for further usage information.

III. You can also install this utility via WInstall.bat and follow the
   instructions during installation. WInstall.bat can be invoked in two ways.

   WInstall.bat installation-folder-name
   WInstall.bat

   In second case, install script will ask user for installation folder name.

   It is advisable to have working installations of perl and atleast one command
   line unzipper (Unzip/CakeCmd) before running this install script, so that it
   can automatically set the desired paths in installed files.

   You can use

   - Cygwin perl or Strawberry perl [http://strawberryperl.com/] or any other
     Windows native perl implementation 
   - Cygwin unzip or UnZip for Windows [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/unzip.php]
   - CakeCmd unzipper [http://www.quickzip.org/cakecmd.html]
