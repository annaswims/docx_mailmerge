docx2txt (http://docx2txt.sourceforge.net/) is a simple tool to generate
equivalent text files from Microsoft .docx documents, with an attempt towards
preserving sufficient formatting and document information, and appropriate
character conversions for a good text experience.

You need to atleast have perl installed on your system for using this tool.


How to Use
----------

You can do the text conversion in different ways depending upon your usage
environment.

1. Using docx2txt.sh :

   docx2txt.sh file.docx
          OR
   docx2txt.sh file

   In both these cases output text will be saved in file.txt .

2. Using docx2txt.bat :

   docx2txt.bat file.docx
          OR
   docx2txt.bat file

   In both these cases output text will be saved in file.txt .

3. Using docx2txt.pl :

   a. docx2txt.pl infile.docx outfile.txt

      Use - as the name of output text file, to send extracted text to STDOUT,
      that is, console.

   b. docx2txt.pl file.docx
             OR
      docx2txt.pl file

      In both these cases output text will be saved in file.txt .

   Input can also be provided via STDIN (console) using - as the name of input
   docx file. Moreover redirection of input/output is possible with this script,
   making it feasible to invoke it in even more ways as illustrated below.

   c. docx2txt.pl < infile.docx

      In this case input is read from infile.docx and output is sent to STDOUT.

   d. docx2txt.pl < infile.docx > outfile.txt

      In this case input is read from infile.docx and output is sent to
      outfile.txt .

   e. cat infile.docx | ./docx2txt.pl

      In this case content of infile.docx is read via STDIN and output is sent
      to STDOUT.

   f. cat infile.docx | ./docx2txt.pl - outfile.txt

      In this case content of infile.docx is read via STDIN and output is sent
      to outfile.txt .

Input argument in all the above cases can also be a directory holding the
unzipped content of a .docx file. This feature is particulary useful if you do
not have a commandline unzipping tool like Unzip/CakeCmd installed on your
system.

Usage help can be obtained by giving '-h' as the first argument to the script.

   docx2txt.pl -h


Tune your Experience
--------------------

You can change following settings via docx2txt.config file that is looked for
- in the current directory,
- user configuration directory (APPDATA on Windows, HOME on non-Windows), and
- in the system configuration directory (same directory that holds the script
  files on Windows, /etc or as set during installation on non-Windows),
in the specified order. In case script does not find any configuration file, it
continues with builtin default settings.
 
a. Path to unzip program
b. Path to temp directory
c. Newline in output text file (Unix/Dos way)
d. List level indentation amount
e. Line width (used for short line justification)
f. Showing of hyperlink along with linked text
g. Extra conversion of &...; sequences [Experimental, not needed normally]

You can also adjust list element indicator characters for different levels, in
docx2txt.pl to suit your formatting taste. Currently 8 level list nesting is
assumed, however if you want to deal with deeper nesting, you can adjust that
as well in the perl script, by following the related comments there.


Viewing the text content of Docx file in Editors and File browsers
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. MC (Midnight Commander)
   -----------------------

You can add following binding in ~/.mc/bindings and view the text content of a
.docx file by hitting F3 key (assuming default key mappings) after moving the
cursor over concerned filename in mc pannel.

# Microsoft .docx Document
regex/\.(docx|DOCX|Docx)$
	View=%view{ascii} docx2txt.pl %f -


2. VIm Editor
   ----------

You can add following lines in your ~/.vimrc to view the text content of a .docx
file directly when using vim.

"use docx2txt.pl to allow VIm to view the text content of a .docx file directly.
autocmd BufReadPre *.docx set ro
autocmd BufReadPost *.docx %!docx2txt.pl 

Note that above .vimrc addition will allow you to view the text content of .docx
files specified as command line argument to vim, but not of those read using
":r file.docx".

Please refer to http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/autocmd.html for more
information on autocmd.
 

3. Emacs Editor
   ------------

You can add following lines in your ~/.emacs file to view the text content of
a .docx file directly when using emacs.

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.docx\\'" . docx2txt))

(defun docx2txt ()
  "Run docx2txt on the entire buffer."
  (shell-command-on-region (point-min) (point-max) "docx2txt.pl" t t))

Be warned that with above ~/.emacs code addition, if you happen to save the
buffer/file, it will overwrite the .docx file with the text content.

Please explore "Filters -- making things readable:" section at
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryExternalUtilities for more ways to view
.docx file text content directly in emacs.


Request
-------

If you are using this work directly/indirectly for non-personal purpose(s),
please inform the author about it along with relevant url(s), so that it can be
mentioned on the project homepage.

In case you come across some issue with it, or need a feature that can be
handled in docx to text conversion, please feel free to communicate. An
accompanying test .docx document depicting the issue/need and the corresponding
text file generated by MSOffice with character substitution enabled (or as you
would like the text file to be) will be helpful.

You can track the project via http://sourceforge.net/projects/docx2txt and refer
to project cvs if there have been changes since this release.
